# Kidney Stone Detection Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of urine test results to detect the presence of kidney stones.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on the following attributes derived from urine tests:
- **Gravity**
- **pH**
- **Osmolality**
- **Conductivity**
- **Urea**
- **Calcium**
- **Target** (binary indicator: 1 for presence of kidney stone, 0 for absence)

### Visualizations

The following visualizations are included:
- **Histograms**: To visualize the distribution of each attribute.
- **Boxplots**: To show the central tendency and variability of each attribute, grouped by the `target`.
- **Correlation Matrix**: To examine pairwise relationships between attributes and their correlation with the `target`.
- **Scatter Plots**: To explore potential patterns and correlations between pairs of attributes.
- **Pair Plots**: To visualize relationships between multiple pairs of attributes.
- **Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) Plots**: To provide smoothed estimates of attribute distributions.
